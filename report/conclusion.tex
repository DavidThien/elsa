\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have demonstrated a method for for synthesizing encodings
  for untyped lambda calculus terms and functions in parallel, based on an
  abstract specification of the behavior of those terms.
We call this dual specification of terms and function \textit{co-synthesis}.
Co-synthesis is made possible in the case of untyped lambda
  calculus, because there is no structural difference between terms and
  functions, only a difference in the meaning ascribed to them.
This means that evaluation of unknown terms simply involves carrying out
  regular lambda calculus evaluation with potential free variables, which
  are the expressions we are synthesizing.
Using bottom-up fair enumeration, we were able to synthesize functions and
  terms in boolean, natural number, and pair encodings, as well as
  co-synthesize the encoding for booleans.
