\section{Future Work}
Although we were able to co-synthesize encodings for church expressions,
  our synthesizer remains relatively naive.
We have an intuition that there is some sort of structure to the types
  of expressions which will actually prove useful for encoding terms
  and functions, but we have yet to discover what that property is.
Future work could look at discerning some of that structure, which could
  potentially allow us to generate far more complex terms than we have now.
