Despite many advances in program synthesis for functional
languages, the problem of synthesizing expressions in the
untyped lambda calculus remains largely unexplored.
%
In this work we study this problem identifying that its key
challenge is coming up with a practical way to specify
behavioral constraints.
%
We develop some general principles which serve as a basis
for specifying functions beyond its extensional behavior.
%
This idea is expressive enough to specify the behavior of
functions over given data encodings.
%
We then show how to extend these principles to build
\emph{co-specifications} for data types and their functions
unlocking the possibility of automatically deriving
encodings as a product of synthesis.
%
Finally, we implemented this ideas in a prototype
enumerative synthesizer proving they are useful in practice
to specify the behavior of functions for their synthesis.
