  Despite advances that have been made in program synthesis, synthesizing
    untyped lambda expressions remains a challenge due to the difficulty in
    coming up with a specification, and the inherent connection between the
    encoding chosen for the terms, and the generated functions.
  To this end, we describe our technique for co-synthesis, which allows
    us to create a higher-level specification for the functions and terms
    of our encoding based on their behavior, and then synthesize a given
    encoding for such terms.
  We describe refinements we have made to the search process to help
    travers the search space of potentially non-terminating programs, as well
    as the reasoning behind our method of specification.
